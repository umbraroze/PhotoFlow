# Photo Importinator: Things to do

## Crucial

- Error handling
  - The DNG conversion step error handling is especially crucial
- To investigate: Capture the output of external tools and put them in the log
- Documentation
- Code structure
- More thorough use of the logger. It was kind of a last minute idea.

## Feature ideas

- Better reporting of the end results
- During the queue population, put source file sizes to the data
- Before backup: Calculate estimated backup size.
- Give a warning/hard fail if the backup drive doesn't have enough space for backup
