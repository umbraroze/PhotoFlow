# Photo Importinator: Usage

## Terminology and basic premise

The Photo Importinator moves (or converts) files from a *source* to a *target*.

A *source* can be either

- an SD card (technically speaking, a local volume with a
  [DCIM][DCIM] folder), or
- a locally synced cloud drive (technically speaking, uh, any local folder
  will do, as you need to provide your own cloud syncing solution anyway).

A *target* is any folder that your computer/user has access to. Usually,
this is a NAS folder that is either mounted somewhere (in Windows, appears
as a drive letter) or is accessible through a locator (in Windows, accessible
through a server path *Ã  la* `\\NAS-SERVER\photos`). Each target also has
a distinct way of organising files (e.g. "files in my NAS server should be
organised under `YEAR\MONTH\DAY` hierarchy").

## Configuration file

The configuration file template is provides as `photo_importinator_config.example.toml`.
Copy the file to `photo_importinator_config.toml` in the appropriate configuration
directory, edit it appropriately as needed, and you're good to go.

### Location

The configuration directory is located in AppData in Windows
(`~\AppData\Local\photo_importinator\`)
and in XDG configuration directory in POSIXy world
(usually `~/.config/photo_importinator/`).

You should create the folder in case it doesn't exist, and why would
it, if you haven't used the app before - that'd be quite weird,
right?

### The content

#### Backup

```toml
[Backup]
7zip_path = 'C:/Program Files/7-Zip/7z.exe'
```

This just specifies the path where your command-line
7-Zip executable lives. (The default value is just where the
64-bit Windows version lives.)

#### Target

```toml
[Target]
default = 'NAS-SERVER'

[Target.NAS-SERVER]
path = '//NAS-SERVER/photos'
backup_path = 'C:/Data/PhotoDump'
folder_structure = '{year:04d}/{month:02d}/{day:02d}'
```

The `Target` section defines the various targets where your files will end up in.
`default` specifies the default which you'll want to use; can be left
undefined or as `'None'` if you want no default to be set.

Folder structure: Use slashes `/` for path separation here, even in Windows.
The `{stuff in curly braces}` gets replaced by the number so named,
using uses [Python formatting rules][pyformat].
Long story short:
`:04d` in above template is "4-digit decimal, with leading zeros" and
`:02d` is "2-digit decimal, with leading zeros".
This is flexible enough if you want the folders to have names like
*2020 of the so-called Common Era/the month we counted as number 6/the day 10 of our monthly ordeal*
(why would you, though), but if you want, say, actual month names,
then this gets hella trickier.

Note how the target subsections are named in the configuration file. If you want your
target to be named `BLAH`, then the configuration should be in the section called
`[Target.BLAH]`. Same goes with the cameras below.

#### Conversion

```toml
[Conversion]
dnglab_path = 'dnglab.exe'
convert_flags = ['--dng-thumbnail', 'false']
```

This specifies the path to dnglab executable,
and the command-line flags given to the `convert` action.

#### Cloud

```toml
[Cloud]
Dropbox = 'Dropbox/Camera Uploads'
OneDrive = 'OneDrive/Pictures/Camera Roll'
```

These declare the *cloud sources*.
The paths are relative to home directory/folder.

#### Cameras

```toml
[Cameras]
default = 'None'

[Cameras.Nikon_D780]
card = 'D:'
card_label = 'NIKON D780'
ignore = [ 'NC_FLLST.DAT' ]
convert_raw = [ '.NEF' ]

[Cameras.Nokia]
card = 'OneDrive'
```

As with targets, the default camera can be specified here, or left as `'None'`.

The internal camera names (in this example, `Nikon_D780` and `Nokia`) will also
be used as prefixes of backup files (e.g. `Nokia_20241122.7z`).

For cameras, the only real required key is `card`. Just specify the drive letter
in Windows or mount point in POSIXland. Or, if it's a cloud source, just specify
which!

The `card_label` feature is not actually used anywhere, but one day I might
*(might!)* implement card auto-detection. Or at least some
verification doohickey. Just use whatever name the camera uses for the card
for now.

`ignore` is a list of files that should be ignored. (In this example, some
Nikon mystery data file.)

`convert_raw` should list which file extensions trigger the automatic DNG
conversion using dnglab.
