# My photography workflow scripts

[The PhotoFlow repository](https://github.com/umbraroze/PhotoFlow)
contains my photography workflow scripts. This includes my photo
import script (Photo Importinator) and some other smaller scripts
that I use for various purposes.

This website is still very much in progress, partly because I'm busy
rewriting Photo Importinator in Python!

## Contents

* **[Photo Importinator](photo_importinator/)** - My strangely
  flexible photo import script.
* **[Photo Geo Scooper](geo_scooper/)** - Put your
  photography journeys on the map! Reads any given directory
  with photos, extracts coordinates, and puts them in a KML
  file.
* Other scripts (documentation forthcoming)
